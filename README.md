# OCN750 - Advanced Programming in R
Code for homework assignments for Advanced Programming in R, taught by Kyle Edwards at U of Hawaii Manoa, Fall 2015. I have updated and cleaned many of these assignments Fall of 2016. I believe currently this class goes by a different title and is not technically a 'seminar' as it was when I took it.
This repo is intended for my personal records and reference purposes only. Users are reminded of the U of Hawaii policies on academic integrity and student conduct:
