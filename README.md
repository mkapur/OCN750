# OCN750 - Advanced Programming in R
Code for homework assignments for Advanced Programming in R, taught by Kyle Edwards at U of Hawaii Manoa, Fall 2015. I have updated and cleaned many of these assignments Fall of 2016. Most include both an RMD and HTML Notebook version. I believe currently this class goes by a different title and is not technically a 'seminar' as it was when I took it.

I have not included the CSV files provided with the assignments - this is for reference and my personal records only.
